- [ ] Advanced filtering (by industry, size, growth rate)
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF reports, enhanced Excel)
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets

### 6. Database & API Optimization
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add API versioning (/v1 endpoints)
- [ ] Standardize API response format
- [ ] Add request validation with Zod

## Advanced Features (Phase 3 - 4-8 weeks)

### 7. Analytics & Visualization
- [ ] Trend analysis with growth rates
- [ ] Industry benchmarking
- [ ] Interactive dashboards with drill-down
- [ ] Additional chart types (bubble, heatmap, etc.)

### 8. SEO & Accessibility
- [ ] Add structured data (JSON-LD)
- [ ] Generate sitemap.xml
- [ ] Improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 9. Documentation & DevEx
- [ ] Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Improve setup documentation

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Search functionality | High | Low | 1 |
| Loading states | High | Low | 1 |
| Database indexes | High | Low | 1 |
| Company comparison | High | Medium | 2 |
| Testing suite | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| Advanced analytics | High | High | 3 |
| Full accessibility | Medium | High | 3 |

## Quick Start Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. Add database indexes:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_companies_year_id ON companies(year_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_companies_pib ON companies(pib);
   CREATE INDEX idx_companies_income ON companies(total_income);
   ```

2. Add loading states to Dashboard component

3. Implement company search:
   ```typescript
   const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
   const filteredCompanies = companies.filter(c => 
     c.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
   );
   ```

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Zero security vulnerabilities

## Resources Needed
- PostgreSQL database with proper access
- Node.js environment for development
- Testing infrastructure setup
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Next Steps
1. Set up local PostgreSQL or cloud database
2. Implement Phase 1 critical issues
3. Set up testing infrastructure
4. Begin Phase 2 implementation

This improvement plan provides a clear roadmap for enhancing ITStats.me from a technical demo to a production-ready application.
